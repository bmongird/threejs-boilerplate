## Project
This is boilerplate code for a threejs project which has 3 different rooms, a cube, and a fully animated character. You have to import the character yourself as a .glb file since it's not mine and place it into the public/assets/models folder.

### Installation
cd into the portfolio directory in your terminal and execute
```npm install```
Then, run 
```npm run dev```
to start the program.
